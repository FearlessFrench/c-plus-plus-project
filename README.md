# C++ Project
### About
C++ is a __cross-platform programming language__ that is widely used to create high-performance applications. Developed by __Bjarne Stroustrup__ as an extension of the C language, C++ offers programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory. It is an __object-oriented language__, which means it emphasizes using data fields with unique attributes (objects) rather than logic or functions.

### Key Features
C++ is known for its versatility and efficiency, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Some of the common use cases include:
- __Operating Systems__: Many operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X, are developed using C++.
- __Game Development__: C++ is popular in game development due to its performance and ability to handle complex 3D games and multiplayer games.
- __Web Browsers__: Browsers like Mozilla Firefox and parts of Google Chrome are developed in C++.
- __Embedded Systems__: C++ is used in embedded systems that require programs to be close to the hardware, such as smartwatches and medical equipment.

### Getting Started
To run these projects, you can simply use the Python code from each folder and run it on any IDE you prefer.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git

2. Navigate to any C++ folders, for example:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name/01_variables_and_basic_data_types/helloworld.cpp

3. Open the terminal in VS Code by pressing Ctrl+ (backtick) and run the following command to compile your code:

   ```bash
   g++ -o helloworld helloworld.cpp

4. After compiling, run the executable by typing the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
